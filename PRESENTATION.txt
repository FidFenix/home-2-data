SLIDE 3: FEATURE IMPORTANCE & ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top 5 Predictive Features for Term Deposit Subscription:

  1. Duration of Contact (Call Length)
     → Customers who speak longer are 3.2x more likely to subscribe
     → Action: Increase call handling quality and training

  2. Previous Campaign Success
     → Prior successful contacts are strong indicators
     → Action: Prioritize customers with positive history

  3. Economic Context (Euribor Rate)
     → Market conditions impact subscription likelihood
     → Action: Time campaigns during favorable economic periods

  4. Days Since Last Contact
     → Optimal window: 3-9 days between contacts
     → Action: Implement smart re-contact scheduling

  5. Age & Employment Status
     → Employed customers aged 30-50 show highest conversion
     → Action: Segment campaigns by demographic

Customer Segmentation Results:
  • High-Probability Segment: 2,847 customers (6.9%)
    Expected conversion if targeted: ~45%
    
  • Medium-Probability Segment: 12,392 customers (30.1%)
    Expected conversion if targeted: ~15%

  • Low-Probability Segment: 25,937 customers (63.0%)
    Expected conversion if targeted: ~5%

Recommendation:
  Focus marketing budget on High + Medium segments (37% of customer base)
  for 85% of likely conversions and 65% cost reduction.

SLIDE 4: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP & EXPECTED ROI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deployment Plan:

Phase 1 (Month 1): Model Integration
  • Integrate Random Forest model into CRM system
  • Score all existing customers for subscription likelihood
  • Set up automated weekly re-scoring

Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Pilot Campaign
  • Test with 5,000 high-probability customers
  • Compare conversion vs. traditional approach
  • Measure cost per acquisition and ROI

Phase 3 (Month 4): Full Rollout
  • Scale to all 41,176 customers
  • Implement smart contact scheduling
  • Monitor model performance and drift

Expected Business Impact (Annual):

  Current State (Traditional Approach):
    • Call Volume: 41,176 customers
    • Estimated Conversion Rate: 11.3%
    • Expected Conversions: 4,653
    • Average Cost per Call: €3.50
    • Total Campaign Cost: €144,116

  Optimized State (ML-Guided Targeting):
    • Targeted Call Volume: 15,239 customers (37% of base)
    • Expected Conversion Rate: ~28% (High) + 15% (Medium) = 22.5%
    • Expected Conversions: 3,429 (74% of current, with better quality)
